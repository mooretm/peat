<h2>Version 2.0.2</h2>
<p>Date: May 14, 2024</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<ol>
<li>Replaced white noise calibration file with 1 kHz warble tone scaled to -30 dB.
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Version 2.0.1</h2>
<p>Date: March 5, 2024</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<ol>
<li>Added several unit tests to test suite.</li>
<li>Added validation for several fields in the File&gt;Settings window.</li>
<li>Updated README file with list of valid test frequencies.
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>

<h2>Version 2.0.0</h2>
<p>Date: February 29, 2024</p>
<h3>Major Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Added RETSPLs to levels to achieve perceptually-balanced presentations across frequencies.</li>
<li>Calculated appropriate "random" starting phases to avoid constructive/destructive interference as much as possible. </li>
<li>Fixed random seed when choosing permissible starting phase values to ensure consistency in test results across trials, frequencies, and sessions. </li>
<li>Moved stimulus generation to the start of each run, avoiding re-synthesizing on each trial to improve processing time. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Minor Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Added new key binding/unbinding logic to avoid multiple responses during a single trial.</li>
<li>Levels are now rounded to two decimal places so Excel doesn't give conversion warning.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<ol>
<li>Refactored stimulus code. 
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>Date: February 15, 2024</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Exposed staircase parameters for minimum and maximum permissable presentation levels.</li>
<li>Added option to display or hide staircase plots after each threshold.</li>
<li>Added help documentation. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fixed a bug where threshold calculations were averaged across subjects.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where threshold calculations were averaged across conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Patches</h3>
<ol>
<li>Refactored threshold calculation code.
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Version 0.2.0</h2>
<p>Date: February 12, 2024</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Added multichannel stimulus capabilities, with random starting phases for each channel (for use in the sound field).</li>
<li>Added a 0.5-second pause at beginning of each trial (to offset the button click from the next trial onset).</li>
<li>Added interactive message boxes for participants after each threshold has been obtained (to delineate runs/frequencies).</li>
<li>Removed staircase plots from output (to blind participants to performance). 
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Version 0.1.0</h2>
<p>Date: February 08, 2024</p>
<h3>Initial Release</h3>
<ol>
<li>Application for estimating auditory thresholds using a 2IAFC task.
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
